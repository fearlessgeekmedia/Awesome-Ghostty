# Awesome Ghostty

## About Ghostty
[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) is a fast, feature-rich, and cross-platform terminal emulator that uses platform-native UI and GPU acceleration. It is created and maintained by [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://github.com/mitchellh).

Ghostty is a very feature-rich terminal.

Terminal features can be divided into two categories: features for end-users and features for terminal application developers.

Features for end-users are things like multi-window, tabs, splits, ligatures, auto-update, etc. These are features that make using a terminal more pleasant without requiring any changes to the running terminal applications (such as your shell, text editor, etc.).

Features for terminal application developers are things like the Kitty graphics protocol, Kitty keyboard protocol, synchronized rendering, light/dark mode notifications, etc. These features allow terminal applications to do more than they could in other terminal emulators. While these features are not directly used by end-users, end-users benefit from them because terminal applications they use every day can do more.

For a full list of features, visit the [features section](https://ghostty.org/docs/features) in the Ghostty documentation.
